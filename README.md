# SOLID

# Explanation of SOLID Principles in Each UML Diagram  

## 1. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) - `refactoredSRP(S)`  
- The classes in this diagram follow SRP by separating concerns:  
  - `Car` handles only car properties and comparison.  
  - `CarDb` is responsible for database interactions.  
  - `CarStr` deals with string representations of cars.  
  - `CarComp` is used for car-related computations.  
  - `CarManager` acts as a coordinator without violating SRP.  
- This ensures that each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.  

## 2. OCP (Open/Closed Principle) - `ResourceAllocator(O)`  
- The system is open for extension but closed for modification.  
- `ResourceAllocator` depends on an interface (`ResourceHandler`), allowing new resource types (e.g., `TimeSlotHandler`, `SpaceSlotHandler`) to be added without modifying the allocator itself.  
- This enables easy extensibility while keeping the core logic unchanged.  

## 3. LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) - `DuckSystem(L)`  
- `IDuck` defines a common interface for all duck types.  
- `NaturalDuck` and `ElectronicDuckAdapter` both implement `IDuck`, meaning they can be used interchangeably in `Pool` without breaking functionality.  
- `ElectronicDuckAdapter` adapts `ElectronicDuck`, ensuring it fits the expected behavior.  

## 4. ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) - `DoorSystem(I)`  
- Instead of forcing all doors to implement unnecessary methods, separate interfaces (`Door`, `TimerClient`, and `ProximitySensorClient`) are created.  
- `TimedDoor` only implements `TimerClient`, and `SensingDoor` only implements `ProximitySensorClient`, preventing unnecessary dependencies.  
- This ensures that classes only depend on the methods they actually use.  

## 5. DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) - `EncodingSystem(D)`  
- `EncodingModule` depends on abstractions (`IReader` and `IWriter`) instead of concrete implementations (`FileReader`, `NetworkReader`, `FileWriter`, `DatabaseWriter`).  
- This allows for flexibility and easy replacement of data sources without modifying `EncodingModule`.  
- The high-level module (`EncodingModule`) is independent of low-level details, following DIP.  

Each UML diagram correctly applies the main SOLID principle indicated in its name. ðŸš€
